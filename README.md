# LegoRoboticArmAssembly
Building lego sets with a robotic arm in mujoco simulation.

The Franka Emika Panda robot arm and the Allegro right hand are files taken from the mujoco_menagerie github. Please check out their work as well, as they are doing great things. You can find a link to their github below that also contains the original source files for the Franka Emika Panda robot arm and the Allegro right hand.
